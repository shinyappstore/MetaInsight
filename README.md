#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/MetaInsight](https://shinyappstore.com/a/MetaInsight)__

MetaInsight is a user-friendly application designed for conducting Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) without the need for specialized software installation. Leveraging established analysis routines, specifically the netmeta and gemtc R packages, MetaInsight provides an interactive and intuitive 'point and click' interface. The application presents NMA results in visually appealing ways, aiming to assist users without expert statistical programming skills. This accessibility is expected to broaden the scope of researchers conducting NMA, enhance the relevance of published meta-analyses, and ultimately contribute to improved decision-making in healthcare. NMA is a method for identifying optimal treatments for various conditions and is widely utilized by healthcare decision-makers. Existing software for NMA often requires advanced statistical programming skills, limiting its accessibility to a broader audience. Published: Rhiannon K.
